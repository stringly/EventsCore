# EventsCore

This project is my attempt at employing Clean Architecture principles to develop a web app in MVC Net Core that will allow users to schedule and manage events for which other users can register.

## Getting Started

This is a personal project that is in development. It is not live or deployable. As of this writing, only the /Domain and some unit tests are implemented.

As part of the learning process for this project, I will attempt to keep good documentation on the "public" APIs. You can view the documentation on the [EventsCore API Documentation Page](https://stringly.github.io/EventsCore/index.html)

## Built With

* [NetCore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/) - Web Framework
* [XUnit](https://xunit.net/#documentation) - Unit Testing
* [DocFx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) - Documentation
* [Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) - O/RM data access

## Acknowledgements
* I've attempted to apply the Clean Architecture principals used in [Jason Taylor's Northwind Traders Project](https://github.com/jasontaylordev/NorthwindTraders/tree/master/Src) during the development of this project.
